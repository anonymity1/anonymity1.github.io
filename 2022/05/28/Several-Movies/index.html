<h2 id="Mulholland-Drive"><a href="#Mulholland-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Mulholland Drive"></a>Mulholland Drive</h2><p>Mulholland Drive (stylized as Mulholland Dr.) is a 2001 surrealist neo-noir mystery film written and directed by <strong>David Lynch</strong> and starring Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, Mark Pellegrino, and Robert Forster. It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in Los Angeles, who meets and befriends an amnesiac woman (Harring) recovering from a car accident. The story follows several other vignettes and characters, including a Hollywood film director (Theroux).</p>
<p>The American-French co-production was originally conceived as a television pilot, and a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch’s plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch’s cut, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch’s characteristic surrealist style, has left the general meaning of the film’s events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics, and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline “A love story in the city of dreams”.</p>
<p>Categorized as a psychological thriller, Mulholland Drive earned Lynch the Prix de la mise en scène (Best Director Award) at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, sharing the prize with Joel Coen for The Man Who Wasn’t There. Lynch also earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. The film boosted Watts’s Hollywood profile considerably, and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller.</p>
<p>Mulholland Drive is often regarded as one of Lynch’s finest works, receiving universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike. It was ranked 28th in the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound critics’ poll of the best films ever made, and topped a 2016 BBC poll of the best films since 2000.</p>
<p>It is really a great movie for many critics, but I have not finished watching this whole movie, since it is really long and boring for me.</p>
<h2 id="Ramsy-Bolt-GoT"><a href="#Ramsy-Bolt-GoT" class="headerlink" title="Ramsy Bolt (GoT)"></a>Ramsy Bolt (GoT)</h2><p>Lord Ramsay Bolton, born Ramsay Snow, was the legitimized bastard son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, and the unidentified wife of a miller.</p>
<p>During the War of the Five Kings, Ramsay is initially loyal to King in the North Robb Stark, retaking Winterfell from Theon Greyjoy on his orders but at the same time sacking the castle as part of his father’s scheme to betray House Stark. Following the successful capture of Winterfell from the Ironborn, Ramsay holds Theon captive and utilizes extreme torture to break him into loyal submission; renaming him “Reek.” Following Robb’s murder and the decimation of the Stark-loyal northern army at the Red Wedding, he follows his father in pledging allegiance to House Lannister and is legitimized as Ramsay Bolton. Through an arrangement orchestrated by Petyr Baelish, Ramsay is wed to Sansa Stark, who escapes from Winterfell along with Theon. Their escape drives Ramsay to murder his entire family on threat of being disinherited, he then becomes the new Warden of the North and Lord of Winterfell, replacing his father. Ramsay’s rule over the North, however, comes to an end when Jon Snow retakes Winterfell with army of Free Folk and Stark loyalists. Ramsay is subsequently executed for his crimes, rendering House Bolton extinct and restoring House Stark as the ruling family of the North.</p>
<h2 id="American-Psycho"><a href="#American-Psycho" class="headerlink" title="American Psycho"></a>American Psycho</h2><p>American Psycho is a 2000 horror film directed by Mary Harron, who wrote the script with Guinevere Turner. It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Chloë Sevigny, Samantha Mathis, Cara Seymour, Justin Theroux, and Reese Witherspoon. Based on Bret Easton Ellis’ 1991 novel American Psycho, the film follows Patrick Bateman (Bale), a New York City investment banker who leads a double life as a serial killer. The satirical film blends horror and black comedy to mock 1980s yuppie culture and consumerism, exemplified by Bateman.</p>
<p>Ellis considered his controversial novel potentially unfilmable, but producer Edward R. Pressman was determined to adapt it and bought the film rights in 1992. Stuart Gordon, David Cronenberg, and Rob Weiss considered directing the film before Harron and Turner began writing the screenplay in 1996. They sought to make a 1980s period film that emphasized the novel’s satire. The pre-production period was tumultuous; Harron chose Bale to play Bateman, but distributor Lions Gate Films was so adamant to cast Leonardo DiCaprio—then considered the world’s biggest actor—that it fired and replaced Harron with Oliver Stone. After Stone and DiCaprio left due to creative differences, Harron was rehired and Lions Gate begrudgingly let her cast Bale. Principal photography began in February 1999 in Toronto and New York City with a $7 million budget.</p>
<p>American Psycho debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2000, and was released theatrically on April 14, 2000. The film was a financial success, grossing over $34 million against a $7 million budget, and received mostly positive reviews, with praise for Bale’s performance and the screenplay. It has developed a cult following and, more recently, a strong presence in contemporary meme culture. A direct-to-video sequel, American Psycho 2, was released in 2002, although it has little relation to the original.</p>
<h2 id="There-will-be-Blood"><a href="#There-will-be-Blood" class="headerlink" title="There will be Blood"></a>There will be Blood</h2><p>There Will Be Blood is a 2007 American epic period drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, loosely based on the 1927 novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair.[4] It stars Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview, a silver miner turned oilman on a ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California’s oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Paul Dano, Kevin J. O’Connor, Ciarán Hinds, and Dillon Freasier co-star.</p>
<p>The film was produced by Ghoulardi Film Company and distributed by Paramount Vantage and Miramax Films. At the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival it won the Silver Bear Award for Best Director and a Special Artistic Contribution Award for Jonny Greenwood’s score. The film grossed $76.2 million worldwide against its $25 million budget.</p>
<p>There Will Be Blood received widespread critical acclaim for its cinematography, direction, screenplay, score, and the performances of Day-Lewis and Dano. Day-Lewis won the Oscar, BAFTA, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, NYFCC and IFTA Best Leading Actor awards for the role. It has been widely regarded by critics as one of the greatest films of the 21st century, and it appeared on many critics’ “top ten” lists for 2007, including the American Film Institute, the National Society of Film Critics, the National Board of Review, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. At the 80th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for eight Oscars (tying with another Paramount Vantage/Miramax co-production No Country for Old Men). The nominations included Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for Anderson. Along with Day-Lewis’ Oscar for Best Actor, Robert Elswit won the award for Best Cinematography。</p>
<h2 id="Love-Death-and-Robots"><a href="#Love-Death-and-Robots" class="headerlink" title="Love, Death and Robots"></a>Love, Death and Robots</h2><p>Love, Death &amp; Robots (stylized as LOVE DEATH + R⬤BOTS, and represented in emoji form as ❤️❌🤖) is an adult animated anthology streaming television series created by Tim Miller and streaming on Netflix. Produced by Blur Studio, it consists of stand-alone episodes that contain different narrative and animation and are produced by different animation studios from a range of countries, exploring diverse genres particularly comedy, horror, science fiction, and fantasy. Each episode is connected to the themes of the titular subjects matter. However, not each episode includes all three topics. Miller serves as the showrunner and producer alongside Joshua Donen, David Fincher, and Jennifer Miller.</p>
<p>The series is a re-imagining of Fincher and Miller’s long in-development reboot of the 1981 animated science fiction film Heavy Metal, which was originally planned to follow the feature length format of the original film but one that could be better adapted for the new generation. The project however was in development hell for eleven years, until Netflix agreed to be the distributor of the project but instead of a film it would be released as a television series. The series premiered on March 15, 2019, with 18 episodes under 20 minutes long. In April 2020, ahead of the second season premiere, Netflix renewed the series for an eight-episode third season. Season three was released on May 20, 2022, with nine episodes, one of which was a sequel to the season one short “Three Robots”.</p>
<p>The show has received acclaim from critics, with praise for each episode animation style, creativity, diverse storylines, and themes. The show has won several accolades from the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.</p>
