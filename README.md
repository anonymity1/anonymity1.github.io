# Looking forward from backward

We can't connect the dots looking forward; we can only connect them looking backwards. 

So we have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in our future. We have to trust in something --- our gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever --- because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give us the confidence to follow our heart, even when it leads us off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.
