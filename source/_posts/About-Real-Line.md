Simply, real line is an infinite, totally ordered and continuous **set**, a strongly stricted set.

## Continuous

Continuous is an extremely strong condition, since we can not even find one set with continuation in our real world.

Almost every substance can be divided into a small atom, and as an illustraion, the letters exhibited on our screens is also composed of massive electronics.

This point is so common in daily life, but I never realized and thought of it before somewhat due to the mathematics education I have been given in past several years.

## Totally Ordered

An order set is a relational structure $(S, \preccurlyeq)$ such that the relation $\preccurlyeq$ is totally ordering.

This condition can be seen in our lifestyles but also difficult to satisfy. Needless to say totally ordered, if one set is partially ordered, the set must be quite useful to create some technologies.

## More Words

Actually we study many operations on the real line, such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division, limit, integral and differential.

However, maybe we ignore the simplest thing, the mapping relationship between real-world items and the abstract mathematics models. But an observed and changeable real world is the origin of our interest while interest is the motivation why we do one thing. Unfortunately, the education we were given and maybe, our next generation in mainland will be given would be abounding with disconnected theory and reality. What's worse, the next generation will have to accept some so-called preconceived “knowledge” full of ideology whatever the **truth** is, whereas they can not resist it, even can not make a sound. They will doubt what they have learned from the textbooks when they stepped into this society. Not until then do they realize the lies in their education but interest is lost, and the only thing they can do, is to admit what happened, and afterward feed up with their next generations at that time.
