The most important thing to realize in this game is that the player is an omnipresent, immortal leader of a country in which the rulers and armies within it will follow your every command. Europa Universalis IV is a game in which **YOU** explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate.

The start date of 1444-11-11 (11th of November 1444) is set up to be as historical as possible. However, as soon as the game is unpaused, history will often veer off its rails and become an alternate Earth where players can influence the destiny of nations. While rulers of different dynasties might rule the nation, the player still guides it until the end date or the last province is lost.

There are no specific victory conditions in Europa Universalis IV, and the players are free to take history in whatever direction they desire. Even though score exists, it's only used in some multi-player games. Your goal could be to take a small nation with a single province and turn it into a powerhouse, take control of a historically powerful nation and cause it to crumble, or anything in between. Many players tailor their games toward earning specific achievements. Game events are based on real history and can often be further researched via Wikipedia or other sources. 

## Hints

Starting the first game as the **Ottomans**, possibly the strongest nation on Earth at this time, is advised. The Ottomans have just defeated the forces of Europe at Battle of Varna and conquered a large part of Greece, so they start out with a peace treaty with some nations. It gives the Ottomans time to conquer some small nearby countries before any larger wars begin. Major nations are a good choice since you can recover even after finding yourself on the losing side of a war, especially since doing a re-conquest and taking back provinces is very satisfying. Read a nation's wiki page to get some understanding of its situation in the game.

A normal game might be over after 100 hours. In this game, the community is still considering a player with just **500 hours** as a beginner to the game. There are many who have played this game for thousands of hours. So expect to enjoy this game for a long time.

## What this game is not

This is not a pure wargame.

This is not a roleplaying game.

This is not a tactical combat simulator.

This is not a turn-based game.

This is not a quick-binge game.

This is not a Civilization game.

## Beginning Country

**Ottomans** which in 1444 is a military powerhouse in the Eastern Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, with many opportunities to expand militarily with leeway for mistakes due to its sheer stature.

**Castile** which in 1444 is arguably the dominant state in the Iberian peninsula, yet without any major rivals save the southerly Berber states of Granada, Morocco etc., and later France, who however is not particularly interested in conquering Spanish land. Castile also has interesting missions and events, quick short-term goals to form the Kingdom of Spain and the Reconquista, easy long-term goals such as colonization, while domestically it is almost entirely religiously and culturally unified.

**Portugal** which in 1444 has the potential to become the biggest colonial power and only has two immediate neighbors: Castile, who is friendly towards you, and Morocco, who can be easily neutered using the aid of Castile.

## Manage Government

The most important button in this game is at the top left-hand corner of the screen. It will look like a shield with the flag of your nation on it. When you click this button, a window appears with many different tabs at the top, showing your leader and their stats as well as spots of vacant advisors. Before you go along and fill them up, you need to worry about the currency of the game. 

Go to the fourth tab and it will show you the economy of the nation. Most nations start the game with an economy that is making money every turn. You should check back periodically to make sure that your nation is always profitable. Now, it is time to go back to that first menu and hire some advisors. There are three slots for three different categories of advisors: administrative (represented in-game with a paper and quill), diplomatic (represented in-game with a dove) and military (represented in-game with two crossed swords). You may only have one of each type. If you are making less than 4 ducats per month you shouldn't hire any advisors. If you are making less than 30 ducats per month you should stick with an advisor with a level of 1. This is because advisors increase in cost quadratically according to their rank. Different advisors may provide different bonuses on different values in game according to their category. So military advisors may give a boost to your army, while diplomatic advisors offer more bonuses in relation to other countries. It doesn't really matter what kind of advisor you pick for now, as long as you find one for each category. If you read the description on them, you can tell what sort of advisor they are. Later on, you can pick them for a specific need, but since all of them are relatively useful, just go for the cheaper ones.

## Territory & Armies

Now that you have selected your advisors and are still making money, it is time to look at your nation. Your nation will be composed of one or more provinces. Your country is only comprised of land provinces. No one truly "owns" sea provinces, though you have the ability to affect naval control and trade in nearby sea provinces.

There will always be a capital province in your nation. If you know world geography, these often correspond to where the capital of the country is today. London is the capital province of England and so on. There may also be a separate trade capital, though the national capital is most often the same province as your trade capital.

You may notice some figures on your provinces, such as a 3D "toy soldier" to represent your armies or small 3D ships. These are the units that you will use to fight wars. Your neighbors will have their own forces. Building units takes quite a while, so you should always have some units on hand. If you go to the interface screen that you were at earlier and go to the military tab you can see how many land and naval units you have as well as your force limit. The force limit is a "soft cap" which means that you can build over that quantity of regiments or ships, except that each additional unit will cost more and more. You can click on a particular unit to select it or drag click over an area to select multiple units.

Moving units to a friendly province will result in a yellow arrow. Moving units to an enemy province or one besieged will have the arrow show as red. If you keep a unit selected as it moves, the progress between provinces actually looks like a progress bar. You can cancel the move until they are halfway there. Halting a move doesn't have a direct repercussion on your troops except that if you want to move to that same province again you'll have to restart the march all over again. Movement may also subject the unit to other effects, such as attrition due to supply limits, weather, or moving over hostile territory.
