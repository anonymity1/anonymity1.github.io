We live in a society with various circles. If we want to realize something, it is a good choice to join a corresponding circle and use the power of it to help you achieve that.

Whatever, circle is much more effective than individual efforts in this team-based society.

## Rethink Monarchy: From a View of Circle

Also, circling is important to promote influence in both individual and group level. Most of the time, there is no right or wrong, but only how much individual agree with you.
If you want to increase your or your group discourse, you need to make other individual either acqiure some benefits or approve your opinions. From this view, you can see that no one cares about the fact or truth in a game of thrones, whereas what others can get from you or think of you is the point.

I have talked about the disadvantages of monarchy in my previous article "GFW and Monarchy". Now I want to dicuss the drawbacks of monarchy from a view of circle. 

Before the topic of monarchy, I want to speak of the individual awareness, which is really an unexplored thing for human, leading to the profitability and exploration desire of human beings in this era.
It is hard to imagine how the disordered atoms and moleculars form one person's body and occur the individual awareness.
Even if today we have computers to code and implement many complicated programs, it is almost impossible for the numerous coders to create the individual awareness.
We can only feel and observe the features of individual awareness from the lives. Most of the time, people's individual awareness will be heterogeneous but it is shaped by their experiences.
Simply we can divide these experiences into two parts: proactive and passive. Considering individuals in one monarchy organazation need to be educated for many years and there is no speech freedom in such an organization, so the passive experiences individuals can touch is mostly shaped by the dictators.
However, when they have conflicts of interest with other individuals--this is easy to happen in future hundred years--the nature of the individual awareness will be aroused.
Thus, the procative part of experiences will have influence on the shape of individual awareness.
Certainly, if the competition among individuals won't be occur, the aformentioned  profitability and exploration will not occur. 
Instead, other features will emerge depending on the particular common experiences individual in this era need to face.

Most of the time, to be a dictator in one organization means the more power in resource allocation, leading to a high position beyond other members in one group. 
Since the competition awareness of individual due to their proactive experiences in this era, they can not easily accept one overpower ruler above their heads provided no more benefits.
And the dictator tends to restrict his or her members' privilege taking the convinience of managing organizations into account. Thus, the contradiction between rulers and the governed comes out.
Besides, it is not easy for other organizations with power balance to accept the groups with monarchy due to the potiential competition awareness of different groups. 
Dictators have to endure the stress from both internal and external and hence he can only use the passive experiences the governed have to suffer in order to strengthen the authority of him. 

Anyway, let's view the group as a circle. Notice that as a member of a specific circle he has to cocmpete with individuals of other groups. 
Individual from other groups would consider themselves first. Remember that a person without boold relation would never think of you first. 
Thus, the sorrow as a member of circle with monarchy occurs. On the one hand, he has to subvert the dictator of his own circle; on the other hand, he can not easily assimilate into other circles.
In my opinion, one generation has one generation particular responsibility. 
Individuals from monarchy circle is responsible for telling the **truth**, just like the age of enlightment. Joining other circle can have a better life, but can not truly assimilate into other circles. Submitting to the monarchy can realize the individual prosperity and wealth, but it really goes against the heart yearning for freedom.
