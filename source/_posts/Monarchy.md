Monarchy is bad for almost all the organazations beacuse people in this system intend to keep good relationship with resource allocators rather than create value in their lives. In addition, such phenonmenon is in fact an elephant in the room which can not be easily changed because of limitations on the freedom of freedom. Time goes by, organizations will not move forward and a **"Human-Eaten"** society will formulate.

GFW, of which full name is the Great Firewall, is famous as the Great Wall in the world. GFW is used to block access to selected websites and to slow down cross-border internet traffic in China. GFW has deeply affected the lives of everyone's life in China and government didn't want to admit it. At the legislative level, overcoming the wall is strictly limited, *however*, not from the **clear laws**--they even deny the existence of GFW. The government use some elastic laws which *only* they know how to interprete to arrest and threat the anti-people.

"If the punishment is unknown, the power is unpredictable." Is that over? No, the elastic laws is not only about GFW, "Pick a Quarrel" criminal, "Spread Rumor" criminal, and many other laws is interpreted by the resource allocators. These laws were made to formulate a better world, but almost they were executed only on the general people.

Strict Legislation, General Illegal, Selective Enforcement. This is a common phenomenon and balance in our society, just like the existence of GFW. GFW holders know the climbers, both holders and climbers acquiesced it, some bad luck guys will be found and caught, and no one knows whether he or she has a good luck. But if you become a resource allcator, things will change a lot. You can interprete the elastic laws as you wish, you use this law to arrest the person you hate and protect the person you like. So you need to keep good relationship with the biggest resource allcator--monarchy, to have more power. And then, relationship, but not creativity become the most useful skill in our society. Finally, time goes by, organizations will not move forward and a **"Human-Eaten"** society will formulate.
