## Fresh

Fresh is a 2022 American **comedy thriller** film directed by Mimi Cave, in her directorial debut, from a screenplay by Lauryn Kahn. It stars Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan. The film is a co-production between Legendary Pictures and Hyperobject Industries; Adam McKay produced the film alongside Kevin J. Messick and Maeve Cullinane. The plot follows a young woman who starts dating a charming man, only to discover his horrifying true nature. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2022, and was released on March 4, 2022, on Hulu by Searchlight Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

## Scream

Scream (also known as Scream 5) is a 2022 American slasher film directed by Radio Silence (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. It is the **fifth** installment in the Scream film series. Though billed as a relaunch of the film series, the film is a direct sequel to Scream 4 (2011) and is the first film in the series to not be directed by Wes Craven, following his death in 2015. The film is dedicated to Craven at the beginning of the closing credits. The film stars Melissa Barrera, Kyle Gallner, Mason Gooding, Mikey Madison, Dylan Minnette, Jenna Ortega, Jack Quaid, Jasmin Savoy Brown, and Sonia Ammar, alongside Roger L. Jackson, Marley Shelton, Skeet Ulrich, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Neve Campbell, who reprise their roles from previous installments. The film takes place twenty-five years after the original Woodsboro murders, when yet another Ghostface appears and begins targeting a group of teenagers who are each somehow linked to the original killings. Similar to previous entries, Scream combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of black comedy and "whodunit" mystery to satirize the trend of reboots and legacy sequels. The film also provides commentary on the horror fandom culture, particularly the divide between "elevated horror" and classic slasher films.

## Nerve

Nerve is a 2016 American **techno-thriller** adventure film directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman and written by Jessica Sharzer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Jeanne Ryan. The film stars Emma Roberts, Dave Franco and Juliette Lewis, and revolves around an online truth or dare game, which allows people to enlist as "players" or "watchers" and as the game progresses further, the players are contacted and invited to participate in more dangerous and risky dares than their prior ones.

The film premiered at the SVA Theater on July 12, 2016 and was theatrically released on July 27, 2016, by Lionsgate. It received positive reviews from critics for its energy and the chemistry of its cast, and grossed over $85 million worldwide against a $19 million budget.

## Red Notice

Red Notice is a 2021 American action comedy film written, directed, and produced by Rawson Marshall Thurber. **Dwayne Johnson**, who also served as a producer, stars as an FBI agent who reluctantly teams up with a renowned art thief (Ryan Reynolds) in order to catch an even more notorious criminal (**Gal Gadot**). The film marks the third collaboration between Thurber and Johnson, following Central Intelligence (2016) and Skyscraper (2018).

Originally planned for release by Universal Pictures, the film was acquired by Netflix for distribution. It began a limited theatrical release on November 5, 2021 before digitally streaming on the platform on November 12, 2021. The film received mixed reviews from critics and positive response from the audience, who praised the performances of the cast (particularly Reynolds and Johnson), humor and action sequences but criticized lack of originality. It became the most-watched film in its debut weekend on Netflix, as well as the most-watched film within 28 days of release on the platform. It also became the 5th most-streamed movie title of 2021.

Finally, it's time to study and work.
