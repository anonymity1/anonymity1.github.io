Each country is headed by a ruler. In EU4, rulers are influential in the running of a country, having between 0 and 6 points of administrative, diplomatic and military skill; these skills contribute directly to the nation's monthly generation of monarch power. Rulers may be either a **monarch**, who as an heir inherits the title from a relative in a monarchy, or an **elected leader** of a republic or theocracy.

## Monarchy

Monarchs (rulers of countries with a monarchy government type) rule until death, and have an heir to succeed them and inherit the throne.The system is nearly identical to EU3's system of monarchs, heirs and dynasties.

A dynasty is acquired through:

- Spread from other dynasties

- Pretender rebels

- Events: Dynamic “disasters”, such as the War of the Roses or the Castilian Civil War, or generic events, such as some of the Dynastic events.

Dynasties, especially those initially found in powerful countries, can be shared by several countries. A shared dynasty grants a +25 bilateral bonus to relations with all countries with which the dynasty is shared.

Spreading your dynasty involves first and foremost royal marriages, prestige and several other parameters.

A shared dynasty is one of the requirements for the claim throne mechanic, which is an important part of the succession war and inheritance mechanics.
